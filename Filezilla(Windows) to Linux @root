1. Ensure Root Login is Permitted
Edit the SSH Configuration: Open the SSH configuration file on your Linux machine:
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Permit Root Login: Ensure the following lines are set correctly:
PermitRootLogin yes
PasswordAuthentication yes

Restart SSH Service: Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:
sudo systemctl restart ssh

2. Set Root Password
Ensure that the root user has a password set:

sudo passwd root

Enter and confirm the new password.

3. Use SSH Key Authentication
Generate SSH Key Pair: On your Windows machine, generate an SSH key pair using a tool like PuTTYgen or the ssh-keygen command:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f my-ssh-key
This will generate two files: my-ssh-key (private key) and my-ssh-key.pub (public key).
Copy Public Key to Linux Machine: Copy the contents of my-ssh-key.pub to the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file on your Linux machine:
sudo mkdir -p /root/.ssh
sudo nano /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
Paste the contents of my-ssh-key.pub into this file and save it.
Configure FileZilla to Use SSH Key:
Open FileZilla.
Go to Edit > Settings > Connection > SFTP.
Click on Add keyfile... and select your private key file (my-ssh-key).
In the Site Manager, set the Logon Type to Key file and specify the path to your private key.

4. Verify IP Address
Ensure you are using the correct IP address of your Linux machine. You can find it using:

hostname -I

Use the IP address that is not 127.0.0.1 or 127.0.1.1.

5. Connect with FileZilla
Open FileZilla: Start FileZilla on your Windows machine.
Add a New Site: Go to File > Site Manager and click New Site.
Enter Connection Details:
Host: Enter the correct IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100).
Protocol: Select SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol.
Logon Type: Select Key file or Normal (if using password).
User: Enter root.
Connect: Click Connect to establish the connection.
